Train Hopper gets realtime data from the MTA and gives you departing and arrival times for any stations on the LIRR.  Simply set your home/work stations, and you'll get departing right in your today notifications so you don't have to open the app.

v1.2 (added station names to extension)

v1.3 (upcoming)
- location services to automatically suggest nearby stations 
- timestamps for last updated so users know information is fresh
- station screen for setting from/work with separate departures/arrivals screen
